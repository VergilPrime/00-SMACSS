##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Educated guess, all the class and id selectors probably go to individual modules, items floated around probably changed the layout of the page entirely. General changes such as fonts and colors go into base.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

My grasp on CSS is still pretty poor so I made as few changes as I could.
